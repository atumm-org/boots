Boots [WIP]
=====

Boots is a Python library that takes the hassle out of bootstrapping applications. It offers a set of tools and abstractions that help developers manage the initialization and configuration of different application components in a systematic and orderly way.

With Boots, you can create "bootable" components, each representing a distinct part of your application's setup process. Then, you can use a boot-loader to coordinate their initialization. This method encourages modularity, reusability, and separation of concerns, making your application more straightforward to develop, test, and maintain.
