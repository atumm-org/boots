Buti [WIP]
==========


Buti is a Python library that is responsible for bootstrapping applications. It offers a set of tools and abstractions that help developers manage the initialization and configuration of different application components in a systematic way.

We can create "bootable" components, each representing a distinct part of your application's setup process. Then, we can
use a boot-loader to coordinate their initialization. This method encourages modularity, reusability, and separation of concerns, making your application more straightforward to develop, test, and maintain.
